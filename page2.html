              <p class="syn-text">
                explores the idea that time is not a line but a state of
                awareness. There is no past to return to and no future to arrive
                at — there is only the present moment, constantly reshaping
                itself. Written with clarity and restraint, the story follows
                characters who begin to sense that what they call “now” is not
                fleeting, but central — a force that quietly governs memory,
                choice, and consequence. As perception shifts, ordinary
                experience gives way to something more expansive, where moments
                overlap and meaning is no longer fixed. The narrative is
                accessible and reflective, intended for readers of all ages, and
                especially for adolescents encountering these questions for the
                first time. Rather than offering answers, THE TIME BEING invites
                attention: to how time is felt, how it is inhabited, and how
                presence itself may be the only true measure of existence.
